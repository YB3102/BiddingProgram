# CLI Bidding Program Simulation

This is a sample command-line simulation for a bidding program.

It simulates adding new users to the database.
Users can either be a buyer or seller.
Multiple users can choose to bid on an item placed by a seller.
The highest bidder is given the item when the seller closes a bid.
The program keeps track of all bids, account balances, and every user's owned items.

To run it, simply use `make all` in your choice of command-line interface; this will generate a main file.
This program file (main.exe on Windows) can be run from the terminal.
For Linux and Mac machines, the Makefile might need to be slightly tweaked for `make clean` statements.

Thank you for checking out the project.
